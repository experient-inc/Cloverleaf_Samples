# Cloverleaf - Perl feed example
Please see clFeedPull.pl complete help information, or via the `get-help` cmdlet to view it in-console.  This includes a variety of samples as well.

### Dependencies
This script uses Perl 5, as well as (typically) requiring the following explicit CPAN package installations:
-JSON
-REST::Client

### Setup
CLFeedPull.ps1 is fairly standalone; you can place it in any directory you want.  By default, the script will create a child directory called "feedRes" under the current script directory and write the feed results there to a filename displayed during execution.
